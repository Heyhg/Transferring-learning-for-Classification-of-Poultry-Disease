1. Introduction
    * Project Title: Transferring Learning for Classification of Poultry Disease
    * Team Members:
       

2. Project Overview
    * Purpose:
        This project aims to develop an Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning solution, specifically leveraging Transfer Learning, to accurately classify various poultry diseases from image data. The primary goal is to provide a reliable and efficient diagnostic aid for farmers and veterinarians, contributing to early disease detection and management in poultry farming.
    * Features:
        - Image-based classification of common poultry diseases.
        - Utilization of pre-trained deep learning models (e.g., ResNet, VGG, Inception) for feature extraction.
        - User-friendly interface for uploading images and viewing classification results.
        - High accuracy in differentiating between healthy and diseased poultry, and among different disease types.
        - Scalable architecture for potential future expansion with more disease categories.

3. Architecture
    * Frontend:
        The frontend of the application is designed to be interactive and intuitive. It is built using [Specify frontend technology, e.g., Streamlit, Flask with Jinja2 templates, React, Angular, or a simple command-line interface]. This layer handles user input (image uploads), displays classification results, and provides necessary feedback to the user.
    * Backend:
        The backend serves as the core processing unit for the machine learning model. It is implemented primarily in Python and utilizes [Specify backend framework, e.g., Flask, Django, FastAPI]. Key components include:
        - Image pre-processing modules.
        - The loaded Transfer Learning model (e.g., fine-tuned TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch model).
        - API endpoints for receiving image data, performing inference, and returning predictions.
        - Error handling and logging mechanisms.
    * Database:
        For this project, the primary data consists of image files for training and testing the model. Metadata (e.g., image labels, timestamps, user history if applicable) can be stored using [Specify database, e.g., CSV files, SQLite for local storage, MongoDB for NoSQL, PostgreSQL for relational data]. The database stores information about classified images and potentially user accounts.
